<h1>
	Designing for Readability
</h1>
<p>
	I recently stumbled upon some cool stuff which isn't on DuckDuckGo and
	had a little time on my hands so I thought it would be a great time to
	finally update my blog. So then I loaded it up and saw how ugly both
	the styling and the code behind it were, must be time for a rewrite!
	[1]
<p>
	Over the last few years since I last touched this blog post I have been
	growing more and more grey hairs by switching to vim for all my text
	editing and adopting plain text for basically everything due to it's
	portability and readability (especially LaTeX). So decided I wanted my
	blog to also plain text masterpiece with the design goals
<h3>
	I need to be able to read it
</h3>
<p>
	I have some difficulty reading a lot of typography, especially
	anything that's slabs of sans-serif with weird contrast (it's probably
	undiagnosed dyslexia), so if I can comfortably read it, it's probably
	half decently designed.
<h3>
	You need to be able to read it
</h3>
<p>
	Meaning it should be able to be viewed however the user wishes and just
	work, whether that be using firefox configured to use the opendyslexic
	font, in a terminal via curl, on a 3DS outside in direct sunlight, etc.
<h3>
	The source code needs to be readable
</h3>
<p>
	If I was going to write and edit posts directly in HTML, it needs to be
	logically laid out and look nice in any text editor with the content
	being the focus. Ideally the layout of the source code should closely
	resemble the layout of the resulting content.
<p>
	So the solution here is to write everything in plain static HTML.
	Although there's 2 slight problems with that
<ol>
	<li>
		The HTML tag system can be very verbose, visually cluttering
		the source
	<li>
		The default styling that modern browsers use is terribly
		unreadable
</ol>
<h2>
	Content structure
</h2>
<p>
	I tried to keep the document structure as sane as possible, so things
	like using h1 for the title, h2 for the section headers and h3 for
	subsection headers. The only thing I did which might be seen as weird
	is not use in text hyperlinks and instead use references. I've decided
	that to keep things consistent, hyperlinks can only be used for site
	navigation (also because anchor tags are long and ugly). To add to
	that, I've decided to follow the Gopher and Gemini protocols in
	requiring that each hyperlink has it's own line for the reasons stated
	on the Gemini faq page: [2]
<blockquote cite="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi">
	It encourages including only the most important or relevant links,
	organising links into related lists, and giving each link a maximally
	descriptive label without having to worry about whether or not that
	label fits naturally into the flow of your main text.
</blockquote>
<h2>
	Fixing the default styling
</h2>
<p>
	I didn't want to have to use CSS, as ideally, how the content is
	displayed should be up to the user but default HTML is so unreadable I
	had to fix it.
<p>
	First up pure black on pure white is blindingly bright so I adopted the
	colors used by the PaperColor vim theme. [3] I find light themes easier
	to read in general but they also have the advantage of being readable
	in a bright environment with lots of glare.
<p>
	Secondly long, left justified lines of text is a nightmare for
	dyslexics, so first I set the maximum line width to 72 characters,
	because that's what Python's style guide, PEP8, recommends for blocks
	of text [4] and added some margins to center the text on the page.
<p>
	Next, Mozilla recommends that line spacing is set to at least 1.5 [4]
	and I completely agree, so I set it to 1.6 but that makes headings look
	weird so they're set to 1.2.
<pre>
<code>
	I use a lot of code samples in this blog and so to visually separate
	them from the rest of the content, they have a white background and
	monospaced font
</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Yes that does mean that the contrast for code blocks aren't great but I
	personally don't find monospaced font on a white background anywhere
	near as offensive as serif or sans-serif font on a white background.
<p>
	Finally I bumped the font sizing up to 1.2em as firefox (and I think
	most other browsers) default to a font size of 16px which isn't bad,
	but personally I find the ~18px size which 1.2em gives you a to be a
	bit more readable. Using em rather then a fixed px value means that the
	page will still respect the browsers font size setting if the user
	requires a larger or smaller font size. Also there's some CSS in there
	to fix oversized images as images don't respect the body max-width.
<p>
	Everything else is left as default. Most importantly, the site will use
	whatever fonts the browser is configured to use meaning if the user
	prefers or requires certain fonts, that's what'll be used.
<h2>
	Abusing SGML
</h2>
<p>
	So my main goal for keeping the source code readable is to focus on how
	the content is presented and not have the HTML tags clutter the
	content. So I indented all the text and made it so that each tag was on
	it's own line. This way it's easy to ignore the html tags when reading
	the content. I also wanted to keep boilerplate code to a minimum as I'm
	not using a templating engine and it doesn't much value to the content.
<p>
	Luckily HTML is an implementation of the Standard Generalized Markup
	Language (SGML) and the SGML standard states that opening and closing
	tags which can be inferred aren't required in the document. An example
	of this is that in this page source, there aren't any head or body
	tags, yet a head and body section is still created by the browser when
	the HTML is being parsed. This is particularly handy because I didn't
	want more then a single line separating consecutive paragraphs for
	readability and I also didn't want to have to have more then one tag
	per line. Hence why there's no closing paragraph tags in the source.
<p>

	Whilst it may not look like it at first glance when compared to the
	more conventional ways of writing HTML, this page is fully HTML 5
	compatible and passes the W3C HTML Checker, [6] implementing many
	recommended best practices such as setting the charset and lang.
<h2>
	Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
	I hope I have inspired others to also take a closer look at the
	readability and accessibility of the content they create. Little things
	such as using a serif font or increasing the line heights can make a
	huge difference when it comes to making your content more accessible
	for everyone.
