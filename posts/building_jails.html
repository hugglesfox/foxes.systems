	Designing Jails
</h1>
<p>
	I've finally gotten around to fixing my backup system as for quite a
	while I haven't had a function backup system. I use BTRFS for my root
	filesystem and really like btrbk [1] as it's simple and mostly just
	works. 
<p>
	Btrbk can use btrfs' built in send and receive to send snapshots over
	SSH to a remote machine. This is great except btrbk requires root
	access on the remote machine so that it can create files with the
	correct permissions. Whilst I'm sure btrbk is well designed and all, I
	still don't really want to give a perl script full root access on the
	backup machine.
