	Applying color theory to Beat Saber
</h1>
<p>
	Beat saber is a game which involves reading little white triangles on
	colored blocks. Identifying shapes via contrast sounds a lot like
	typography so I thought I should take a crack at applying basic
	typography color theory in order to make beat saber easier to play
	(theoretically).
<p>
	Note that I'm neither good at beat saber or at color theory. Do your
	own experiments and find what's best for you!
<p>
	There are 2 colors of blocks, each color maps to which hand you use to slice
	the block with your saber. Additionally each block has a white triangle on it
	indicating the direction it needs to be sliced.

<p>
	So we have the following requirements
<ol>
	<li> 2 visually distinct colors
	<li> White needs to contrast well with both colors
	<li> The colors need to stand out against a typically dark background
</ol>
<p>
	The default colors are red and blue as shown in the image below.

<p>
	After some experimenting I ended up with the color #2986cc (blue) which
	has the complementary color #cc6f29 (orange). [1] is a good resource
	for finding complementary colors.
<p>
	I then used [2] to make sure that both the colors pass the contrast
	check when used as the background for white text.
<p>
	Finding colors which are complementary and pass the contrast test is the
	hardest part. I found starting with a blue to be the easiest.

<p>
	Finally you'll notice there's these big rectangular walls. They default
	to the same red as the left hand block which makes the blocks harder to
	see in front of them. But we can adjust that!
<p>
	I find that walls seem to be more transparent with a lighter color.
	Therefore I picked #c128cc which has a 90° hue offset from my other two
	colors.

<p>
	And we now have nice balanced colors in Beat Saber!
