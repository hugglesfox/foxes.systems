<h1>
	X225 Laptop
</h1>
<p>
	I needed a laptop for traveling, so I built a laptop based on the
	Lenovo Thinkpad X220 and Thinkpad X230 which I'm calling the X225.
<h2>
	Requirements
</h2>
<p>
	The primary use case for the laptop will be to act as a device for
	typing and light web surfing whilst traveling. Therefore I have
	specified to following are the design requirements
<ol>
	<li> Must be easily portable (should fit in a 13" laptop sleeve)
	<li> Must have a good keyboard 
	<li> Must be <lt/>$500
	<li> Should have a long battery life
	<li> Should be repairable (with replacement parts available)
	<li> Should be quiet
</ol>
<h2>
	The Thinkpad X220
</h2>
<p>
	The Lenovo Thinkpad X220 laptop is a classic which is still very well
	loved to this day and it's easy to see why. It has a great feeling
	keyboard, small yet built like a tank, can be picked up on the second
	hand market for relatively cheap and is very modular. So it seemed like
	a good choice
<p>
	However using a laptop which was designed 10 years ago does come with
	some draw backs.
<ul>
	<li> The 2nd gen Intel Core processor runs hot
	<li> No USB 3.0 ports
	<li> The screen, whilst IPS, is only 720p
</ul>
<h2>
	The Thinkpad X230
</h2>
<p>
	The Lenovo Thinkpad x230 is the next generation up from the X220
	featuring USB 3.0 ports, an improved cooling design, and a 3rd gen
	Intel Core processor. The main differences of 3rd gen over 2nd gen is
	the better onboard graphics and increased efficiency which in
	combination with the better cooler, makes the X230 run cooler and
	quieter then the X220. However the X230 has the newer chiclet style
	keyboard which I'm not as big of a fan of compared to the older
	membrane keyboard which is on the X220.
<h2>
	Combinding the two
</h2>
<p>
	The Thinkpad X220 and X230 do share a one main thing  which is the
	chassis. Therefore a common mod for the X230 is to replace the keyboard
	with the one from the X220. But at the time for me, there were no
	undamaged Thinkpad X230's on the market so I decided to do the opposite
	and install an X230 motherboard into a X220.

<h2>
	The water damaged X230
</h2>
<p>
	So I brought a damaged Thinkpad X230 from ebay. It was missing a hard
	drive and battery, the case was cracked from being dropped on one of
	the corners and had what looked to be some minor water damage to the
	screen. However the ebay listing showed it could boot so I was hopeful
	that the motherboard was OK.
<p>
	Upon taking apart the laptop it was very clear that the laptop had
	serious water damage, possibly from salt water. The bottom of the case
	was covered of metal corrosion and some of the metal components such as
	the CPU heatsink mount on the motherboard had rust spots. Fortunately
	it still booted and everything seemed to work.
<h2>
	Black plastic
</h2>
<p>
	A quick detour but possibly one of the reasons why the water damaged
	motherboard still worked was because Lenovo wraps their motherboards in
	a layer of plastic which is glued to the motherboard with a reasonable
	adhesive.  Unfortunately that adhesive leaves a sticky residue which
	can't be easily removed with isopropyl alcohol. I was able to remove
	most of it with a citric acid based adhesive remover but that left a
	orange smelling residue all over the board and the only way to remove
	it was to give the board a wash in warm soapy water. Electronics are
	fine around water right?!
<h2>
	Cleaning up the X220
</h2>
<p>
	The Thinkpad X220 which I also brought was in much better shape. The
	keyboard keys are a little worn and there's a couple of dings but
	that's to be expected of a 10 year old laptop. Lenovo applies a soft
	touch coating to the top of the lid and the underside of the laptop in
	which turns sticky as it ages but that can be  easily removed using
	some magic eraser.
<h2>
	Swapping the motherboards
</h2>
<p>
	The main physical differences between the X220 mother board and the
	X230 motherboard are
<ul>
	<li> The X230 uses a mini DisplayPort port instead of the full
		sized port on the X220
	<li> The front left USB port (next to the Display Port) is slightly
		longer on the X230 compared to the X220
</ul>
<p>
	Whilst the different sized DisplayPort ports is only a problem
	aesthetically (as the display port hole in the case is larger then it
	needs to be) longer USB port does pose a problem as it collides with a
	support on the bottom of the case, pushing the USB port up. The laptop
	will still go together however that USB port won't line up correctly
	with it's hole, stopping one from plugging anything into it. Plus I
	would prefer if the motherboard didn't have to be bent in order for it
	to fit.
<p>
	Luckily this can be solved by filing down the supports a little until
	the board nicely sits in position.
