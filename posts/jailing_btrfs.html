<h1>
	Jailing BTRFS
</h1>
<img src="../media/btrbk_jail.png" alt="A screenshot of the commands ls and clear not working in the jail but btrfs does">
<p>
	I've finally gotten around to fixing my backup system as for quite a
	while I haven't had functional backups (oops). I use btrfs for my root
	filesystem and really like the backup program btrbk [1] as it's simple,
	makes use of btrfs' snaphotting features and just works. 
<p>
	Btrbk can use btrfs' built in send and receive commands to send
	snapshots over SSH to a remote machine. However btrbk needs to run the
	btrfs recieve command as root so that it can create files with the
	correct permissions. Whilst I'm sure btrbk is well designed and all, I
	still don't really want to give a perl script full root access on the
	backup machine.
<p>
	That's when I remembered about those fancy jail things that BSD users
	keep raving about (&lt;3 BSD users) and I have a little experience with
	chroot so I thought creating a jail like chroot envionment might be the
	solution. This way I can configure SSH to use the chroot for a user
	when they login, that way that user doesn't have access to the
	underlying root filesystem and I can control which tools and programs
	are available to the user.
<p>
	So this is the script I came up with a lot of help from [2]
<pre>
<code>
	#!/bin/sh

	# Create an ssh jail for btrbk

	JAIL=/var/jail

	# Create root layout
	mkdir -p $JAIL/backups
	mkdir -p $JAIL/bin
	mkdir -p $JAIL/dev
	mkdir -p $JAIL/lib
	mkdir -p $JAIL/proc
	mkdir -p $JAIL/sbin
	mkdir -p $JAIL/usr/bin
	mkdir -p $JAIL/usr/lib

	# Create devices
	mknod -m 666 $JAIL/dev/null c 1 3

	# Copy binaries
	cp /bin/sh $JAIL/bin/
	cp /bin/cat $JAIL/bin/
	cp /sbin/btrfs $JAIL/sbin/
	cp /usr/bin/readlink $JAIL/usr/bin/

	# Copy required libraries
	cp /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 $JAIL/lib/
	cp /lib/libblkid.so.1 $JAIL/lib/
	cp /lib/libuuid.so.1 $JAIL/lib/
	cp /lib/libz.so.1 $JAIL/lib/
	cp /usr/lib/liblzo2.so.2 $JAIL/usr/lib/
	cp /usr/lib/libzstd.so.1 $JAIL/usr/lib/

	# Mount proc
	mount -t proc /proc $JAIL/proc

	# Mount the data drive
	mount --bind /media/data $JAIL/backups
</code>
</pre>
<p>
	See [2] for a more in-depth explanation but the basic run down is as
	follows
<ul>
	<li> Create the directories required for a unix filesystem
	<li> Create the required <code>/dev</code> special devices (btrbk only
		needs <code>/dev/null</code>)
	<li> Mount <code>/proc</code>
	<li> Copy the binaries needed for btrbk into the places it expects to
		find them
	<li> Copy the libraries required for those binaries (which can be found
		using <code>ldd</code>) into their respective locations
</ul>
<p>
	It probably would be better to use hardlinks for the binaries and
	libraries as that way they can be easily updated by the package manager
	however for the particular system I'm deploying this on, this isn't an
	issue.
<h2>
	Security Issues
</h2>
<p>
	Whilst I'm sure there are many others (if you find one, feel free to
	let me know), there 2 main security problems which I can find
<ol>
	<li> The backup data is accessible and could be modified
	<li> Processes outside the jail are available in <code>/proc</code> in
		the jail
</ol>
<p>
	The first problem is going to be an issue with almost any setup as the
	backup program needs access to the btrfs filesystem to manage the
	backups. Using SSH keys to prevent unauthorized people gaining access
	to the chroot in helps mitigate this.
<p>
	The second problem is one I'm not sure how to best solve. If a bad
	actor were able to login, they would be able to access information
	about processes running outside the chroot environment (such as
	envrionment variables, command line arguments, etc.) from
	<code>/proc</code>, potentially leaking sensitive information. Whilst
	I'm sure there's a way to restrict what's available in
	<code>/proc</code> to only processes running in the chroot, more
	research is required (if anyone can link me to any relevant resources
	it would be appreciated).
